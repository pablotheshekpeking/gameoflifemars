# Mars Colonization - Winning Strategy Guide

## Core Winning Strategy

### Phase 1: Energy Foundation (Generations 1-5)
1. Start with Solar Arrays ONLY:
   - Place 3 Solar Arrays in a triangle pattern
   - Leave one cell gap between each Array
   - Each Array generates 12 energy/generation
   - NO OTHER STRUCTURES YET
   - Wait until energy reaches 70%+

### Phase 2: Resource Balance (Generations 5-15)
1. Add Oxygen Generation:
   - Place 2 Oxygen Generators near Solar Arrays
   - Keep exactly 2-3 neighbors for each
   - Each generates 10 oxygen/generation

2. Add Water Generation:
   - Place 2 Water Extractors
   - Position between Solar Arrays and Oxygen Generators
   - Each generates 8 water/generation

3. Optimal First Cluster Layout:

   - (oxygen emoji) -
   (water emoji) - (sun emoji)

### Phase 3: Protection & Expansion (Generations 15+)

1. Resource Generation Formula:
   - For every 3 structures, maintain:
     - 2 Solar Arrays (24 energy)
     - 1 Oxygen Generator (10 oxygen)
     - 1 Water Extractor (8 water)
   - This offsets decay and generates surplus

2. Shield Generator Placement:
   - Add Shield Generator when resources all above 60%
   - Place in center of productive clusters
   - One Shield Generator can protect up to 8 surrounding cells

## Resource Management

### Critical Resource Rules
1. Energy Management:
   - Must stay above 50% before building anything
   - Build new Solar Array when energy drops below 60%
   - Remove structures if energy falls below 30%

2. Oxygen & Water Balance:
   - Keep oxygen above 40%
   - Keep water above 40%
   - Build new generators at 50% threshold

### Decay Prevention
1. Structure Placement Rules:
   - ALWAYS maintain 2-5 neighbors
   - NEVER place with 6+ neighbors
   - NEVER leave structures isolated (0-1 neighbors)

2. Efficiency Monitoring:
   - Remove red (dying) structures immediately
   - Replace orange (struggling) structures
   - Only expand when all structures are green

## Advanced Tactics

### Automatic Habitat Generation
1. Create this exact pattern for guaranteed Habitat:

   (oxygen emoji) - (sun emoji)
   - - -
   (sun emoji) - -

### Cluster Design
1. Perfect Cluster Template:

   (shield emoji) (sun emoji) (oxygen emoji)
   (sun emoji) - (sun emoji)
   (water emoji) (sun emoji) (oxygen emoji)

### Emergency Recovery
If all resources dropping:
1. Pause game immediately
2. Remove all red structures
3. Remove all structures with wrong neighbor count
4. Keep only Solar Arrays
5. Wait for energy to recover
6. Rebuild using Phase 1 strategy

## Victory Conditions
You're winning when:
1. All resources stay above 70%
2. All structures are green (thriving)
3. Automatic Habitats are forming
4. Multiple protected clusters exist
5. Resources increase even with hazards
